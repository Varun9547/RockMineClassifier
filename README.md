# Rock/Mine Predictor

## Overview
The **Rock/Mine Predictor** is a basic machine learning model designed to classify whether an object in sonar data is a **rock** or a **mine**. This project serves as an introduction to machine learning classification using a simple dataset and model.

## Features
- **Binary Classification**: Classifies sonar readings as either rock or mine.
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled training data to make predictions.
- **Basic Model Implementation**: Uses a simple algorithm for classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses accuracy to understand model performance.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a small dataset containing sonar signal readings. The dataset consists of:
- **Features**: Sonar signal intensity values.
- **Labels**: `Rock` or `Mine`.


## Usage
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Train a basic classification model.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
- Use the model to predict new sonar readings.

## Model Details
- **Algorithm:** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or KNN)
- **Training Data Split:** 90% Training, 10% Testing
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy

## Limitations
- The model is simple and may not achieve high accuracy.
- Limited dataset size may affect generalization.
- No advanced optimizations or hyperparameter tuning included.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different algorithms for better accuracy.
- Implement data normalization for improved model performance.
- Expand the dataset for more reliable predictions.
